I slap together a quick FizzBuzz solution for a simple proof of concept for [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard)

### Steps I took to get this to work ###
- created directory cleancoders/guard
- a little rvm setup

  echo rvm "ruby-1.9.2-p136@guard" > .rvmrc
  rvm gemset create guard

- created Gemfile
- created lib/ directory
- created spec/ directory
